With this app, you can effortlessly upload your PDF files and have your questions answered in both text and voice formats, using the power of OpenAI's language models.

The app provides a user-friendly interface where you can easily select and upload your PDF document. Once uploaded, you can type in any question you have about the content of the PDF.

Not only does this app display the answers in clear and concise text form, but it also takes it a step further by offering a voice-based option. You can choose to listen to the answers being read aloud, enabling a hands-free and immersive reading experience. This feature is particularly useful for users who prefer audio content or have visual impairments.
